  public Feb6Hw() { 
    // do nothing 
  }

// Question 1 
// a) True, because the book said so. No reason why it shouldn't work. 
// b) True, because the object is not bound to an ArrayList. 
// c) False, it returns the removed value. 
// d) False, the value just gets appended, the object isn't saved. 
// e) True, an ArrayList can be duplicated, thus two varibles can refer to it. 

// Question 2 
// a) True, unused spaces still take up memory because those spaces need to be reserved. 
// b) False, add(x) requires more space than the limit, thus requiring the list to be copied and reapplied, which is inefficient. 
// c) False, same reason as above. 
// d) True, don't need to search through as many spaces in the ArrayList. 

// Question 3 
// a, b 

// Question 4 
// [0, 1, 2] 

// Question 5 
  public static ArrayList<String> reverse(ArrayList<String> a) { 
    ArrayList<String> answer = new ArrayList<String>(); 
    for (words: a) { 
      answer.add(0, words); 
    } 
    return answer; 
  }
